Reflections

Tried to be more organised this time by doing the client and server set up when we revised them in class - coding along and setting up my project as part of the work shop. My hope here is that if I start early, if I have any problems during the week when I add to the code then I can learn how to fix them as we revise through the week, and then have more time to fix them. I want to be more prepared for the project. The only thing I'm currently unsure on at this point is how to use postman to check the port is working.
