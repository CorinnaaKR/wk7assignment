Reflections

Tried to be more organised this time by doing the client and server set up when we revised them in class - coding along and setting up my project as part of the work shop. My hope here is that if I start early, if I have any problems during the week when I add to the code then I can learn how to fix them as we revise through the week, and then have more time to fix them. I want to be more prepared for the project. The only thing I'm currently unsure on at this point is how to use postman to check the port is working.
Started yesterday by making my wireframe in figma, then jumping into drawSQL to map out how i wanted my database to look. Then started creating a table of dummy data in supabase to render on the page.
Started going through the demos and pulling the relevant code for the task and putting them in my scratch so that it was all in one place for me to access. I noticed I pinballed between task quite alot so had to keep reminding myself to complete on task at a time. Currently feeling relatively confident with how I'm doing, but I am aware I havent tested any of my code yet which I'm nervous to do.
Ran my db query in SQL to check it worked and it didnt, and realised the data didn't match so made the changes than ran again until query came back. Made the corresponding code changes in in the entries components.
